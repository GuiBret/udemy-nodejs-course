Express : 
    - Framework easing up the creation & usage of a server
    - Handle boring details in order to focus on business logic
    - Alternatives : 
        - Vanilla Node.js (technically works, but cumbersome) 
        - Adonis.js (Laravel-inspired)
        - Koa
        - Sails.js
        - ...
    - Most used framework, lots of packages gravitating around
